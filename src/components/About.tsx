                    Hi, I'm Jia, an Electrical Engineering graduate from the
                    University of California, Riverside. When I first learned
                    about web development, I was fascinated by its similarities
                    to my studies and the endless possibilities it offers. With
                    my background in research and collaboration with others, I
                    bring a strong foundation in problem-solving and critical
                    thinking to my work in software development.
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                    Driven by curiosity and a desire to explore new
                    technologies, I'm constantly finding new ways to build new
                    experiences. Whether I'm experimenting with new frameworks
                    or diving into the latest APIs, I'm always looking for ways
                    to push the boundaries of what's possible with web
                    development.
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                    Outside of coding, I enjoy playing tennis, trying new foods,
                    and traveling.
                </p>
